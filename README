This is the template for assignment 1 of UCLA CS 174A, taught by professor
Demetri Terzoupolos.

This is project 2 of the course.

I created a adventure game, you can play with it with #define PLAY_RECORDER commented out in anim.cpp. Otherwise, program will automatically play the game and change the camera view.

There are new files added:
terrainMap.h maps the structure of objects and terrains.
recorder.h records the camera and player position (not video recording) into motionData.csv file during the game play, and can be replay the game by reading motionData.csv file.
motionData.csv: is data file for camera position and character movment.


Gameplay: If you want to play the game, comment out #define PLAY_RECORDER in anime.cpp
Do not define LOG_DATA, it is used for video recording purpose only

Gameplay keybinding:

i k j l: used for forward backward left and right
u o: used to turn the character
v: used to toggle third person view and first person view

1 2 3: are reserved for boosting performance during video recording only, don't use them.

There are lots of texture file added, so program may run slow on low performance computer.
Youtube Video contains caption as a narrative of video.
